Spectro is a colorful scheme with a dark background. The colors are defined in the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) colorspace.
The main interest over the RGB colorspace, is that it's easy to change the overall brightness of the scheme in order to adapt to different screens. 
The Saturation and Lightness are defined globally with g:spectro_saturation and g:spectro_lightness, which shall be set between 0 and 255.
